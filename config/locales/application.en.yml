        (1) Score: the rating (weighted control effectiveness) of each audit report is calculated as a weighted average. The effectiveness of the control objectives multiplied by their weight are added and the result is divide by the sum of the weights.
        (2) Business processes: business processes are listed in order of their rating from lowest to highest.
        (3) Objectives and scope of work: lists the evaluated control objectives and procedures .
        (4) Issues: lists the titles of the detected issues. If there are no issues, the legend "No issues" is displayed.
